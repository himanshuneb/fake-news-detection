# Fake-News-Detection-Project

The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this project, machine learning ensemble approach has been used for automated classification of news articles. Different textual properties have been explored that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real.
